# Plumage
A web frontend for the [Web Polygraph](http://www.web-polygraph.org/) proxy testing tool.

Plumage lets you define and run Polygraph configurations with varying parameters across different testing machines, possibly using multiple processes to make use of modern multi-core processors, generating and archiving the reports for you.
(It is *not* a graphical editor for Polygraph Language. PGL is too complex and powerful.)

To get started, see the [Plumage wiki](https://github.com/LionsPhil/plumage/wiki).
